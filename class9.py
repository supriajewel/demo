# Object Oriented Programming

# Class and Object
# class person:
#     # atributes or member variable
#     fname = ''    
#     lname = ''

# obj1 = person()         # creating an object
# obj1.fname = 'Jewel'    # sending data to person class through object "obj1"
# obj1.lname = 'Munshi'

# print(obj1.fname)
# print(obj1.lname)

# class person:
#     # atributes or member variable
#     fname = ''    
#     lname = ''

#     def display(self):
#         print(f"Your full name is {self.fname} {self.lname}.")



# obj1 = person()         # creating an object
# obj1.fname = 'Jewel'    # sending data to person class through object "obj1"
# obj1.lname = 'Munshi'
# obj1.display()

# obj1 = person()
# obj1.fanme = 'Zahara'
# obj1.lname = 'Faiza'
# obj1.display()

############# class with constractor  ###############
# constructor initialise object value into the class

# class person:
#     def __init__(self, fname, lname):    # creating a constractor
#         self.fname = fname
#         self.lname = lname

#     def display(self):      # it is method
#         print(f"Your full name is {self.fname} {self.lname}.")

# obj1 =person('Jewel','Munshi')
# obj1.display()

# obj1 =person('Zahara','Tasnim')
# obj1.display()

########## difference between function and method ################
# a function is always independent. it's called independently like print(), len()
# a method is always created insite a class. They called through an object
  # like boj1.display()
